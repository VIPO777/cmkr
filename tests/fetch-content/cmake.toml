# Downloads [fmt v7.1.3](https://fmt.dev/7.1.3/) from [GitHub](https://github.com) and links an `example` target to it:

[project]
name = "fetch-content"
description = "Fetching from git"

[fetch-content.fmt]
git = "https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt"
tag = "7.1.3"

[target.example]
type = "executable"
sources = ["src/main.cpp"]
link-libraries = ["fmt::fmt"]

# This is equivalent to calling CMake's [FetchContent](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html).
